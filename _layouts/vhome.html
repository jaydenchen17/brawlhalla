      <h2>Why We Chose This</h2>
      <p>High schoolers are expected to do a minimum amount of volunteer hours, and it's often hard to find opportunities that align with our interests. A website that is easy to navigate and gives access to different volunteering opportunities will encourage people to volunteer more. This website is very useful for many people in our school who are searching for opportunities.</p>
